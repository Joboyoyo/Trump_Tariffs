        <h2>About Trump's Tariffs</h2>
        <p>President Donald Trump announced an increase in tariffs against major U.S. trading partners on April 2, 2025, which he proclaimed "Liberation Day." These tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries and reduce trade deficits. <br><br>However, the policy has faced criticism for its oversimplified calculation methods and the irrationality of some tariffs, such as the 10% tariff on Heard and McDonald Islands, which are uninhabited except by penguins. The policy also shocked global stock markets, resulting in significant economic losses.</p>
